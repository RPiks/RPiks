👋 Hi, I’m @RPiks

👀 I’m interested in devising software for amateur radio using DSP and statistical algorithms (only in C and C++).

🌱 Having more than 23 years of experience in C/C++, I’m currently learning robust methods of PSK/FSK/OFDM demodulation.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project in C/C++ for HAM/amateur radio.

📫 How to reach me. Please write a letter to piksaykin@gmail.com or a message to QRZ.COM platform (to R2BDY, Roman Piksaykin).

Have a great time.
